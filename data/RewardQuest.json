My concern is for Dun Cormyra and the Chieftess who resides there.\n\nChieftess Cormyra has long defended Lamthota's Sound, and the town of Fintain by keeping the forces of Albion and Midgard at bay. This simultaneous invasion is bringing Dun Cormyra to the brink of capture and that would be disasterous for the realm of Hibernia.\n\nFollow the path south and enter the courtyard of Dun Cormyra. Slay all invaders that you find. Show them no mercy, Celt, for the safety of the realm is at stake. Once you have hewn down the invaders, speak with Sergeant Sakinthlas who stands guard over the last remaining barrier between the barbarians of Midgard and our noble Chieftess Cormyra, he will grant you access to the inner keep.",
